### World of Warcraft Achievements

I started playing WoW during Mists of Pandaria but became serious about raiding in Shadowlands. I achieved AOTC on my own and joined a guild that cleared half the Raid on mythic. In Season 2, I joined a CE Guild, and in Season 3, I was part of a Hall of Fame Guild. Despite taking a break due to personal reasons during Dragonflight's third season and until today, I cherish the memories of thrilling boss kills and the camaraderie with my friends. Nowadays, I primarily focus on coding due to my limited time.
